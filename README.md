# My blog

migrated from Gastby as that's just a major headache.

Things to do:

- add bio
- link rss/twitter/etc
- make a list of redirects
- try deploy to netlify
- update text of leaflet post
- update about this site post

nice to haves:

- add more tweet threads as short posts
- do some more tags
- add littlefoot for footnotes
- sort out ukiyo-e dataset metadata
- extract leaflet code
