# My blog

migrated from Gastby as that's just a major headache.

Things to do:

- make a list of redirects

nice to haves:

- add more tweet threads as short posts
- add littlefoot for footnotes
- sort out ukiyo-e dataset metadata
- extract leaflet code
- indicators for external links
- add tag link page/section
- move work page
