# My blog

migrated from Gastby as that's just a major headache.

Things to do:

- fix tweet links
- add bio
- fix archive/home/all posts links
- link rss/twitter/etc
- make a list of redirects
- try deploy to netlify
- update bigimage on ukiyo-e dataset, and network blending
- fix vimeo links
- update text of leaflet post
- update about this site post

nice to haves:

- add more tweet threads as short posts
- do some more tags
- add littlefoot for footnotes
- sort out ukiyo-e dataset metadata
