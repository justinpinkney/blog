__Takes a picture and rearranges the pixels to make another.__

A little [[generative art]] Java application I made a long time ago which implements an algorithm to take all the pixels from an image and use them to make a new image, based on a (sort of) sorting algorithm.

This was all inspired by [JÃ³zsef Fejes's all RGB sorting]((https://web.archive.org/web/20180812152126/http://joco.name/2014/03/02/all-rgb-colors-in-one-image/)) [work.](http://rainbowsmoke.hu/home) I implemented his basic concept for pixel colour sorting, but using an image as the source of pixels and added lots of options for sort order, distance metrics, and starting patterns. The combination of options as well as the sheer variety of possible starting material (i.e. any image or photograph) produces a huge variety of results which is very fun to curate.
